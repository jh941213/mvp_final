It serves as a foundational tool for generating responses, processing tasks, and managing interactions with these models. This client supports a wide range of functionalities, including message handling, token calculations, tool integration, and managing tool calls, as well as reflecting on tool execution results. It is utilized by various AI agents, such as the CoderAgent, ReviewerAgent, Assistant agent, and solver agents, to perform tasks like generating responses, solving math problems, processing messages, and selecting roles based on chat history.\n\nThe \"CHATCOMPLETIONCLIENT\" can be instantiated using the `load_component()` method and adheres to an abstract base class that defines the interface all language model clients must implement. This includes methods for creating responses, streaming outputs, and managing interactions with the chat completion model. Its robust design enables seamless collaboration between agents and language models, making it a critical component for facilitating dynamic and efficient communication in multi-agent systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605594, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 752, "total_tokens": 989, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
