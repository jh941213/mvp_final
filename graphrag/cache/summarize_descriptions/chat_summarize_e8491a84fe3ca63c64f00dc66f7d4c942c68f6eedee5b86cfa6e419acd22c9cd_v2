It operates based on a standardized protocol that all chat agents must implement, ensuring consistency and interoperability. This protocol defines essential properties such as the agent's name, description, and the types of messages it produces. Additionally, CHATAGENT is equipped with methods for managing its lifecycle and functionality, including handling messages, resetting its state, pausing and resuming operations, saving and loading its state, and closing resources. A key feature of CHATAGENT is its ability to maintain a message count, which supports efficient processing and tracking of user interactions. This combination of structured protocol adherence and dynamic message handling makes CHATAGENT a critical component in collaborative and interactive multi-agent environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605728, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
