It handles agent lifecycles, message delivery, state management, and agent registration while facilitating agent interactions and task processing. This runtime supports intervention handlers for tasks such as termination detection and processes messages sequentially, making it suitable for development and standalone applications. It is specifically tailored for local development and can be embedded in Python applications, providing a lightweight and efficient infrastructure for managing agent execution without telemetry enabled. The runtime ensures streamlined communication and execution in a single-threaded manner, making it ideal for scenarios requiring simplicity and deterministic processing.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605657, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 542, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
