In the context of \"BaseGroupChat,\" it resets the team and participants to their original configuration. Within \"SelectorGroupChat,\" it clears the conversation history, enabling a fresh start for interactions. In \"Workbench,\" it reinitializes the workflow to its starting condition. The \"CustomTermination\" class utilizes the \"RESET\" method to restore termination states, making them ready for reuse in future sessions or tasks, such as \"run\" or \"run_stream.\" More broadly, the \"RESET\" method is instrumental in clearing the state of agent teams or individual agents, erasing prior contexts or interactions, and preparing them for new runs.
