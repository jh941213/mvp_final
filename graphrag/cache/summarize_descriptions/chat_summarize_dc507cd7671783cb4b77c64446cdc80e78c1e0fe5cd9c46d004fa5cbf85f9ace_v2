It serves as an abstract implementation of the Agent protocol, requiring developers to implement the `on_message_impl` method to define custom message handling logic. While it provides no built-in message handling capabilities, it offers essential features such as state management and foundational methods like `register` for runtime integration. BASEAGENT is integral to the tool agent caller loop, enabling agents to act as callers and facilitating their interaction within the system.
