It enables agents to subscribe to and receive messages published to particular topic types, ensuring that relevant messages are routed to the appropriate agents. This mechanism supports unbounded mapping, meaning it does not rely on specific topic sources or agent keys, and is used to filter and route messages efficiently within workflows, such as group chat systems.
