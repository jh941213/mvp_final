This parameter enables the agent to process and interpret tool outputs, allowing it to provide either natural language responses or structured output messages based on the results of tool calls. Additionally, it facilitates the summarization of tool outputs when they are not well-formed natural language strings, ensuring that the agent's responses remain coherent and contextually appropriate.
