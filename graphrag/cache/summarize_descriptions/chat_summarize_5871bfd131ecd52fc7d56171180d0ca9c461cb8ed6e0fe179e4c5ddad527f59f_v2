It operates as a team-based framework where agents interact dynamically, taking turns broadcasting messages. A central orchestrator or model-based mechanism selects the next speaker for each turn based on shared context, specific criteria, or customizable parameters such as selector prompts and candidate filtering. This workflow incorporates a ChatCompletion model to manage speaker selection and supports configurations like max_turns and user-defined selector functions, including the integration of the UserProxyAgent.\n\nThe \"SELECTORGROUPCHAT\" enables ad-hoc conversation flows and task execution by coordinating agents through reasoning models, user feedback, and task-specific descriptions. It allows agents to assume the most appropriate roles for each message or task, ensuring efficient delegation and management. Additionally, it can be swapped with other components, such as MagenticOneGroupChat, to adapt to different task delegation and management needs. This workflow is particularly effective in scenarios requiring dynamic agent selection, expert identification, and collaborative problem-solving.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605658, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 559, "total_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
