It serves as a critical mechanism for defining the behavior, tone, role, and operational parameters of agents, such as specifying that an agent is a \"helpful AI assistant\" or outlining domain expertise, focus areas, or task-specific guidelines. As a subclass of \"LLMMessage,\" it is integral to initializing and configuring the model's behavior, often appearing in the chat history or model context to provide essential system-level information or memory content.\n\nThe \"SYSTEMMESSAGE\" is versatile and can include fields like `content` and `type` to specify its purpose, such as chain-of-thought prompting, response formatting, or guiding the model's output. It is used across various contexts, including chat completions, tool agent caller loops, and broader multi-agent frameworks, to ensure consistent and coherent interactions. By embedding system-level instructions or prompts, it enables developers to set the assistant's role, capabilities, and behavior, ensuring alignment with user preferences, task requirements, and conversational goals.
