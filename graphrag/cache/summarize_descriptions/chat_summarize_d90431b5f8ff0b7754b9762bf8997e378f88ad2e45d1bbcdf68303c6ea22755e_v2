In this workflow, agents take turns contributing sequentially, ensuring a simple, predictable, and evenly distributed execution flow. It supports configurations such as maximum turns and incorporates termination conditions to manage the flow of communication and task completion. This workflow is versatile, facilitating collaboration among agents with distinct roles, such as writer, reviewer, and summarizer, and is designed to handle tasks, manage message exchanges, and maintain state throughout the process. By employing a round-robin approach, it ensures fairness and systematic participation among all agents involved.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605667, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 589, "total_tokens": 734, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
