It is particularly suitable for scenarios without memory constraints, such as simple chatbots or conversation systems requiring the full conversation history to be sent to the model. This context supports diverse modalities, allowing for the integration of multimodal information into system messages and interactions, and is capable of incorporating user preferences, conversation contexts, and facts to generate personalized responses. Additionally, it facilitates the addition of system messages and memory updates, making it a flexible and dynamic tool for managing unbounded chat completions.
