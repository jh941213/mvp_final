It enables the association of specific message types or conditions with these handler methods, allowing agents to process and respond to particular types of messages, such as tasks. By specifying the types of messages an agent can handle, the \"MESSAGE_HANDLER\" facilitates the organization and routing of communication within multi-agent systems, ensuring that each agent's functionality is clearly delineated and aligned with its role in the system.
