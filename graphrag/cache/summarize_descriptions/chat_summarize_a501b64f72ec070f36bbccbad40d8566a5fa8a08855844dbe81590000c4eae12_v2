It provides built-in message routing capabilities, enabling structured communication, task delegation, and interaction management within multi-agent systems. ROUTEDAGENT supports modular and scalable message processing by associating message types or contexts with specific handlers, often using decorators like `@message_handler` and `@rpc`. This class facilitates workflows and state transitions, allowing agents to integrate with tools, execute tasks, and manage interactions in runtime environments. It serves as the backbone for various specialized agent implementations, such as UserAgent, HumanAgent, and MathAggregator, which extend its functionality to address specific use cases like group chats, math problem-solving, or message delegation to other agents like AssistantAgent. By leveraging its high-level routing capabilities, ROUTEDAGENT enables seamless communication and collaboration between components or agents, ensuring efficient and context-aware message handling.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605594, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 658, "total_tokens": 854, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
