It serves as a proxy agent for customers interacting with a chatbot, handling message types such as \"UserLogin\" and \"AgentResponse,\" while also publishing \"UserTask\" messages to AI agents. In group chat scenarios, it acts as the user's representative, facilitating collaboration with other agents by providing user input, feedback, and final approval. The USERAGENT is registered with a runtime and associated with a specific topic type, ensuring seamless integration within the system. It can receive user messages via console input or through a frontend interface for real-world applications. Additionally, it is responsible for delivering the final output to the user, which may involve actions like printing to the console or storing data in a database. This multi-functional agent bridges the gap between human users and the technical framework, enabling efficient interaction and task management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605656, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 435, "total_tokens": 621, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
