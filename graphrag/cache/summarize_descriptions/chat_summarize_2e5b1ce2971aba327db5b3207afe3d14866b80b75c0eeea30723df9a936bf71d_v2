It enables agents to hand off tasks to others based on their specific capabilities, ensuring seamless task planning and execution within a shared message context. SWARM supports team-based workflows where agents collaborate simultaneously, leveraging explicit handoff mechanisms to control task execution and coordination. This framework is particularly suitable for human-in-the-loop interactions, allowing for dynamic team configurations, such as setting parameters like `max_turns`, and ensuring tasks are addressed collaboratively with a defined termination condition. By integrating features like task handoff and team coordination, SWARM provides a robust structure for multi-agent systems to operate cohesively in complex environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605790, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
