It serves as a critical component in multi-agent systems, enabling agents to generate responses, perform tasks, and execute workflows. This client supports advanced features like structured output, response formatting, parallel tool calls, and API key authentication, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including chat completions, tool calling, and task execution. It is utilized by various agents, such as AssistantAgents, orchestrator agents, worker agents, and solver agents, to power interactions, solve problems (e.g., math), and facilitate workflows in systems like Magentic-One.
