It serves as a critical tool for executing, monitoring, and displaying the output of tasks, workflows, and agent interactions in a streaming format. The CONSOLE is capable of running and managing workflows such as SelectorGroupChat, Swarm, GraphFlow, FLOW3, and team-based workflows, enabling seamless communication and task execution among agents. It provides a user-friendly interface for displaying formatted outputs, including messages, task results, and conversation streams, making it an essential utility for debugging, monitoring, and user interaction. Additionally, the CONSOLE supports real-time streaming of outputs from agents or teams, allowing users to view and manage conversations, monitor execution progress, and interact with agents effectively. Its functionality extends to printing messages, displaying output statistics, and managing complex workflows, such as research team operations or assistant agent interactions, ensuring a comprehensive and interactive experience for users.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605597, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 872, "total_tokens": 1070, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
