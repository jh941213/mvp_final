It serves as a comprehensive event structure containing the results of tool calls, including detailed information such as the content, tool name, call ID, output, metadata, and error status. This event is designed to track, monitor, and communicate the outcomes of tool-related actions, often encapsulated as a list of FunctionExecutionResult objects. Additionally, it plays a critical role in monitoring function executions and can be utilized to trigger termination conditions or other actions within a multi-agent system.
