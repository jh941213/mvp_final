It is a versatile and generic data class or object designed to facilitate the exchange of information, instructions, or queries. Each \"MESSAGE\" contains attributes such as `content`, which can be of various types (e.g., text, instructions, or data), and may also include metadata like `id`, `timestamp`, recipient information, or other fields relevant to its context. \n\nMessages serve as the backbone of interaction in AutoGen's multi-agent framework, enabling agents to relay their work, execute instructions, or respond to queries in workflows. They are processed by message handlers and can be routed to agents based on type-based subscriptions or topics. Examples of message content include queries like \"What's the weather in SF?\" or instructions such as \"Run the following Python code: print('Hello, World!')\". \n\nIn addition to their role in agent-to-agent communication, messages are also used in user-agent interactions, supporting tasks like generating plots or retrieving information. This flexible and extensible design ensures that \"MESSAGE\" objects can adapt to a wide range of use cases, making them a critical component of the AutoGen ecosystem.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605594, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 660, "total_tokens": 909, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
