It is generated by an agent to signal the handoff of a task or conversation while maintaining the same message context. This message includes critical information such as the context of the task, the target agent or entity, and, in some cases, the event type. It is utilized in various workflows, such as the Swarm workflow, where it indicates the handoff to the next speaker or agent and is also used to resume tasks within Swarm teams by setting the target to the next agent in line. Additionally, the \"HANDOFFMESSAGE\" is employed by the AssistantAgent to trigger a handoff to another agent when necessary.
