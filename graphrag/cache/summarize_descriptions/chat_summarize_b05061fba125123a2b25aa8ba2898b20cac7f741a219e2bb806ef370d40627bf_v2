It leverages descriptions and type annotations to inform large language models (LLMs) about the tool's purpose and parameters, while automatically generating schemas and validating inputs based on the function's signature and docstring. FUNCTIONTOOL enables Python functions to be seamlessly integrated into tool systems, allowing them to perform specific tasks such as retrieving stock prices, adding numbers, file reading and writing, JSON parsing, list operations, and even generating images. These tools are designed to be executed as part of workflows, workbenches, or by agents like ToolAgent, enhancing their capabilities during task handling. By serving as a bridge between Python functions and AI agents, FUNCTIONTOOL empowers agents to execute well-defined tasks efficiently and effectively within collaborative multi-agent environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605597, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 557, "total_tokens": 737, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
