It serves as a critical component in facilitating communication between users and agents, as well as within workflows involving multiple agents. This message type includes attributes such as `content`, which holds the user's input (e.g., queries, task descriptions, instructions, or feedback), and `source`, which provides metadata about the origin of the message. In some cases, it may also support multimodal inputs, such as a combination of text and images, and include a `type` field for further classification.\n\n\"USERMESSAGE\" is a subclass of the broader \"LLMMessage\" category and is integral to various processes, including chat completion requests, task initiation, and interactions with model clients like ChatCompletionClient. It is used to provide prompts, instructions, or queries to agents, enabling them to generate responses or perform tasks. Within the context of multi-agent chatbot systems, \"USERMESSAGE\" plays a pivotal role in representing user input in conversations, group chats, and tool agent caller loops, often as part of a sequence of messages exchanged between agents and users.\n\nThis message type is versatile and adaptable, functioning as both a carrier of user input and a medium for passing intermediate data between agents in collaborative workflows. Its design ensures that user input is effectively captured, processed, and utilized to drive interactions and achieve desired outcomes in complex multi-agent environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605594, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 906, "total_tokens": 1211, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
