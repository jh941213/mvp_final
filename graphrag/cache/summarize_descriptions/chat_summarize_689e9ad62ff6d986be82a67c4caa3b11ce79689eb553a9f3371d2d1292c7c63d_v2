It is primarily associated with tasks and interactions initiated by the user. First, it acts as a message type published by the UserAgent to the AI agent, encapsulating user input and relevant context to facilitate effective processing. Additionally, it represents a task submitted by the user to the orchestrator agent, signifying its role in task delegation and coordination within the system. Furthermore, \"USERTASK\" is also utilized as a message containing the chat history of a user session, published when an AI agent hands off a task to other agents, ensuring continuity and context preservation during inter-agent collaboration. This multi-faceted role highlights \"USERTASK\" as a pivotal component in maintaining seamless communication, task management, and context sharing across the multi-agent framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605606, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 489, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
