It is composed of attributes such as the agent's name, namespace, type, and instance name, enabling precise identification and differentiation of agents. This identifier is essential for communication, task assignment, and managing agent-specific operations, as it facilitates message routing, metadata retrieval, and direct message delivery to specific agent instances. Additionally, the AGENTID is utilized in events like `MessageEvent` and `AgentConstructionExceptionEvent`, ensuring seamless interaction and error handling within the system. Examples of AGENTID values include combinations like \"tool_agent\" and \"default\" or \"tool_enabled_agent\" and \"default.\" It also includes methods for parsing identifiers from strings, further enhancing its utility in managing agent interactions and operations in the AutoGen framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605594, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 662, "total_tokens": 840, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
