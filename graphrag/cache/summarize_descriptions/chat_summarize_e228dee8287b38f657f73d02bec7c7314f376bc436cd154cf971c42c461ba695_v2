It includes key attributes such as a unique call ID (`id`), the function or tool name (`name`), and the associated arguments (`arguments`) that specify the parameters for the function. This component is utilized in events like `ToolCallRequestEvent` and messages such as `ToolCallSummaryMessage`, serving as a standardized representation of the agent's request to execute a specific function.
