It leverages the MessageContext component to facilitate its functionality. Specifically, the ToolUseAgent utilizes MessageContext to manage additional metadata associated with messages, including critical elements such as cancellation tokens. This integration enables the ToolUseAgent to oversee operations like message cancellation and ensures seamless handling of user interactions by maintaining contextual information about messages.
