A \"FunctionCall\" message serves as the initiation point, representing the input or request for a specific function to be executed. This is subsequently followed by a \"FunctionExecutionResult\" message, which encapsulates the outcome or output of the corresponding function call. Together, these entities form a sequential and interdependent relationship, where the \"FunctionExecutionResult\" directly corresponds to and completes the lifecycle of the \"FunctionCall,\" ensuring a clear representation of both the request and its resolution within the system.
