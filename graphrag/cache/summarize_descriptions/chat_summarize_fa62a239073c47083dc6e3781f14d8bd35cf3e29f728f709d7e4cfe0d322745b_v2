It is an asynchronous generator designed to execute tasks, workflows, or team operations in a streaming manner, enabling real-time interaction and incremental processing of inputs and outputs. This method is implemented in multiple contexts, including the `BaseChatAgent`, `BaseGroupChat`, `SelectorGroupChat`, `AssistantAgent`, and the `TaskRunner` protocol, where it facilitates the streaming of messages or response chunks as they are generated. In the `AssistantAgent`, it supports asynchronous task execution and real-time token output streaming, while in team-based workflows, it enables collaborative task execution with outputs directed to specified destinations, such as a console. The `run_stream` method is functionally similar to the `run()` method but is specifically optimized for streaming scenarios, concluding its operation by yielding a `TaskResult` as the final output. This functionality is particularly useful for dynamic, real-time applications, such as answering user queries or managing research team workflows, where iterative and responsive communication is essential.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605596, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 783, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
