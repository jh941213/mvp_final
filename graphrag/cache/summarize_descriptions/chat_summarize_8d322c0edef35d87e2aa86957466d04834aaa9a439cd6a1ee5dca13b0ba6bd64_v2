It facilitates communication by taking user input and returning it as responses, enabling seamless integration of user feedback into workflows. This agent plays a critical role in collaborative environments by providing feedback, such as approval or disapproval of tasks, during the execution of a team or system. It is particularly versatile, allowing customization of the feedback process through user-defined input functions, such as receiving messages via a web socket connection. Additionally, the USERPROXYAGENT supports interaction with systems like the SelectorGroupChat, ensuring dynamic and adaptable user engagement in complex multi-agent operations. By representing the user in these contexts, it bridges the gap between human input and automated processes, enhancing the overall functionality and responsiveness of the system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605605, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
