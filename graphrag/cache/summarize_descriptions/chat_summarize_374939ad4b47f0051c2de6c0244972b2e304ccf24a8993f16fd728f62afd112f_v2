It encompasses a wide range of activities, goals, or queries, including but not limited to analyzing data (e.g., \"Analyze Q4 sales performance and identify key trends\"), generating creative content (e.g., \"Write a Haiku about the weather in Paris\"), solving problems (e.g., \"Write a Python script or fetch data from an API\"), or addressing user queries (e.g., \"What is the weather in New York?\"). Tasks can involve collaboration, delegation, and routing among agents, and are often designed to achieve specific outcomes, such as conducting market research, planning trips, or responding to user feedback.\n\nEach task is typically represented as a structured object containing attributes like `task_id` and may include a list of messages or instructions detailing the operations required to achieve the goal. Tasks are executed, monitored, and may produce results or termination signals upon completion. They are integral to workflows, such as the SelectorGroupChat or FLOW3, where agents collaborate to complete objectives like \"Start a review process for a document\" or \"Process inputs with mixed priority levels.\" Tasks can also involve processing specific inputs, such as categorizing emotions, summarizing content, or retrieving information, and are tailored to the capabilities of the agents or workflows involved.\n\nIn essence, the \"TASK\" entity serves as the fundamental building block of multi-agent systems, enabling agents to collaborate, execute, and achieve diverse objectives across various technical and operational contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "protected_material_text": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1751605606, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 336, "prompt_tokens": 910, "total_tokens": 1246, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst specializing in multi-agent systems.
