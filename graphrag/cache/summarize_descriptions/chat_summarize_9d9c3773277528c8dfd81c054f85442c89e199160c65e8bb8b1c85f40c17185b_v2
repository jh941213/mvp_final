It is passed to agents or message handlers during message exchanges and provides a comprehensive set of metadata, state information, and runtime details. This includes attributes such as cancellation tokens for managing asynchronous tasks, sender and recipient details, message IDs, topic IDs, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) status, and other relevant environmental or processing information. The \"MESSAGECONTEXT\" serves as a critical mechanism for enabling agents to process messages effectively within distributed systems, offering control, additional metadata, and contextual information about the message and its environment.
