Each agent in the workflow performs a specific task by processing a message, generating a response, and then passing it to the next agent. This pattern is useful for creating deterministic workflows where each agent contributes to a pre-specified sub-task.\n\nIn this example, we demonstrate a sequential workflow where multiple agents collaborate to transform a basic product description into a polished marketing copy.\n\nThe pipeline consists of four specialized agents:\n\n- **Concept Extractor Agent**: Analyzes the initial product description to extract key features, target audience, and unique selling points (USPs). The output is a structured analysis in a single text block.\n\n- **Writer Agent**: Crafts compelling marketing copy based on the extracted concepts. This agent transforms the analytical insights into engaging promotional content, delivering a cohesive narrative in a single text block.\n\n- **Format & Proof Agent**: Polishes the draft copy by refining grammar, enhancing clarity, and maintaining consistent tone. This agent ensures professional quality and delivers a well-formatted final version.\n\n- **User Agent**: Presents the final, refined marketing copy to the user, completing the workflow.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the sequential workflow in this example:\n\nSequential Workflow\n\nWe will implement this workflow using publish-subscribe messaging. Please read about Topic and Subscription for the core concepts and Broadcast Messaging for the the API usage.\n\nIn this pipeline, agents communicate with each other by publishing their completed work as messages to the topic of the next agent in the sequence. For example, when the ConceptExtractor finishes analyzing the product description, it publishes its findings to the \"WriterAgent\" topic, which the WriterAgent is subscribed to. This pattern continues through each step of the pipeline, with each agent publishing to the topic that the next agent in line subscribed to.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom autogen_core import (\n    MessageContext,\n    RoutedAgent,\n    SingleThreadedAgentRuntime,\n    TopicId,\n    TypeSubscription,\n    message_handler,\n    type_subscription,\n)\nfrom autogen_core.models import ChatCompletionClient, SystemMessage, UserMessage\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n```\n\n## Message Protocol\n\nThe message protocol for this example workflow is a simple text message that agents will use to relay their work.\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Message:\n    content: str\n```\n\n## Topics\n\nEach agent in the workflow will be subscribed to a specific topic type. The topic types are named after the agents in the sequence, This allows each agent to publish its work to the next agent in the sequence.\n\n```python\nconcept_extractor_topic_type = \"ConceptExtractorAgent\"\nwriter_topic_type = \"WriterAgent\"\nformat_proof_topic_type = \"FormatProofAgent\"\nuser_topic_type = \"User\"\n```\n\n## Agents\n\nEach agent class is defined with a type_subscription decorator to specify the topic type it is subscribed to. Alternative to the decorator, you can also use the add_subscription() method to subscribe to a topic through runtime directly.\n\nThe concept extractor agent comes up with the initial bullet points for the product description.\n\n```python\n@type_subscription(topic_type=concept_extractor_topic_type)\nclass ConceptExtractorAgent(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, model_client: ChatCompletionClient) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"A concept extractor agent.\")\n        self._system_message = SystemMessage(\n            content=(\n                \"You are a marketing analyst.
