If you are building a custom agent and have events that you want to communicate to other entities (e.g., a UI), you can include these in the `inner_messages` field of the `Response`. We will show examples of this in Custom Agents.\n\nYou can read about the full set of messages supported in AgentChat in the `messages` module.\n\n## Custom Message Types\n\nYou can create custom message types by subclassing the base class `BaseChatMessage` or `BaseAgentEvent`. This allows you to define your own message formats and behaviors, tailored to your application.

If your tool does not return a well-formed string in natural language format, you may want to add a reflection step within the agent by setting `reflect_on_tool_use=True` when creating the agent. This will allow the agent to reflect on the tool output and provide a natural language response.\n\n### Workflow\n\n1. The task is received by the `SelectorGroupChat` which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent).\n\n2. The Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: `<agent> : <task>`\n\n3. Based on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the `SelectorGroupChat` manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask.\n\n4. The Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history.\n\n5. The Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected.\n\n6. The workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either:\n   - The Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends \"TERMINATE\"\n   - An alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages)\n\nWhen defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next.\n\n### Termination Conditions\n\nLet's use two termination conditions: `TextMentionTermination` to end the conversation when the Planning Agent sends \"TERMINATE\", and `MaxMessageTermination` to limit the conversation to 25 messages to avoid infinite loop.\n\n```python\ntext_mention_termination = TextMentionTermination(\"TERMINATE\")\nmax_messages_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=25)\ntermination = text_mention_termination | max_messages_termination\n```\n\n### Selector Prompt\n\n`SelectorGroupChat` uses a model to select the next speaker based on the conversation context. We will use a custom selector prompt to properly align with the workflow.\n\n```python\nselector_prompt = \"\"\"Select an agent to perform task.\n\n{roles}\n\nCurrent conversation context:\n{history}\n\nRead the above conversation, then select an agent from {participants} to perform the next task.\nMake sure the planner agent has assigned tasks before other agents start working.\nOnly select one agent.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nThe string variables available in the selector prompt are:\n\n- `{participants}`: The names of candidates for selection. The format is `[\"<name1>\", \"<name2>\", ...]`.\n- `{roles}`: A newline-separated list of names and descriptions of the candidate agents. The format for each line is: `\"<name> : <description>\"`.\n- `{history}`: The conversation history formatted as a double newline separated of names and message content. The format for each message is: `\"<name> : <message content>\"`.\n\n> **Tip**: Try not to overload the model with too much instruction in the selector prompt.\n>\n> What is too much? It depends on the capabilities of the model you are using. For GPT-4o and equivalents, you can use a selector prompt with a condition for when each speaker should be selected. For smaller models such as Phi-4, you should keep the selector prompt as simple as possible such as the one used in this example.\n>\n> Generally, if you find yourself writing multiple conditions for each agent, it is a sign that you should consider using a custom selection function, or breaking down the task into smaller, sequential tasks to be handled by separate agents or teams.\n\n### Running the Team\n\nLet's create the team with the agents, termination conditions, and custom selector prompt.\n\n```python\nteam = SelectorGroupChat(\n    [planning_agent, web_search_agent, data_analyst_agent],\n    model_client=model_client,\n    termination_condition=termination,\n    selector_prompt=selector_prompt,\n    allow_repeated_speaker=True,  # Allow an agent to speak multiple turns in a row.\n)\n```\n\nNow we run the team with a task to find information about an NBA player.\n\n```python\ntask = \"Who was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons?\"\n# Use asyncio.run(...) if you are running this in a script.\nawait Console(team.run_stream(task=task))\n```\n\n**출력:**\n```\n---------- user ----------\nWho was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons?\n---------- PlanningAgent ----------\nTo complete this task, we need to perform the following subtasks:\n\n1.
