It was founded on November 13, 1851, and incorporated as a town on January 14, 1865, and later as a city on December 2, 1869. The city is named after Chief Seattle. It covers an area of approximately 142 square miles, with a population of around 737,000 as of the 2020 Census, and an estimated 755,078 residents in 2023. Seattle is known by nicknames such as The Emerald City, Jet City, and Rain City, and has mottos including The City of Flowers and The City of Goodwill. The city operates under a mayor–council government system, with Bruce Harrell serving as mayor. Key landmarks include the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, Amazon Spheres, and the Seattle Great Wheel. It is situated on the U.S. West Coast, with a diverse urban and metropolitan area that extends to a population of over 4 million in the greater metropolitan region.\n```\n\n### Agent as a Tool\n\nAny `BaseChatAgent` can be used as a tool by wrapping it in a `AgentTool`. This allows for a dynamic, model-driven multi-agent workflow where the agent can call other agents as tools to solve tasks.\n\n### Parallel Tool Calls\n\nSome models support parallel tool calls, which can be useful for tasks that require multiple tools to be called simultaneously. By default, if the model client produces multiple tool calls, `AssistantAgent` will call the tools in parallel.\n\nYou may want to disable parallel tool calls when the tools have side effects that may interfere with each other, or, when agent behavior needs to be consistent across different models. This should be done at the model client level.\n\nFor `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` and `AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient`, set `parallel_tool_calls=False` to disable parallel tool calls.\n\n```python\nmodel_client_no_parallel_tool_call = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    parallel_tool_calls=False,  # type: ignore\n)\nagent_no_parallel_tool_call = AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant\",\n    model_client=model_client_no_parallel_tool_call,\n    tools=[web_search],\n    system_message=\"Use tools to solve tasks.\",\n)\n```\n\n### Tool Iterations\n\nOne model call followed by one tool call or parallel tool calls is a single tool iteration. By default, the `AssistantAgent` will execute at most one iteration.\n\nThe agent can be configured to execute multiple iterations until the model stops generating tool calls or the maximum number of iterations is reached. You can control the maximum number of iterations by setting the `max_tool_iterations` parameter in the `AssistantAgent` constructor.\n\n```python\nagent_loop = AssistantAgent(\n    name=\"assistant_loop\",\n    model_client=model_client_no_parallel_tool_call,\n    tools=[web_search],\n    system_message=\"Use tools to solve tasks.\",\n    max_tool_iterations=10,  # At most 10 iterations of tool calls before stopping the loop.\n)\n```\n\n## Structured Output\n\nStructured output allows models to return structured JSON text with pre-defined schema provided by the application. Different from JSON-mode, the schema can be provided as a Pydantic BaseModel class, which can also be used to validate the output.\n\nOnce you specify the base model class in the `output_content_type` parameter of the `AssistantAgent` constructor, the agent will respond with a `StructuredMessage` whose content's type is the type of the base model class.\n\nThis way, you can integrate agent's response directly into your application and use the model's output as a structured object.\n\n> **Note**: When the `output_content_type` is set, it by default requires the agent to reflect on the tool use and return the a structured output message based on the tool call result. You can disable this behavior by setting `reflect_on_tool_use=False` explicitly.\n\nStructured output is also useful for incorporating Chain-of-Thought reasoning in the agent's responses.
