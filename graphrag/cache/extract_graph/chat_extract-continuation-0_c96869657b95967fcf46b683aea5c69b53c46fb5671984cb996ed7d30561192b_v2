For example, when the team is running as a web service, you can use a custom input function to wait for message from a web socket connection. The following code snippet shows an example of custom input function when using the FastAPI web framework:\n\n```python\n@app.websocket(\"/ws/chat\")\nasync def chat(websocket: WebSocket):\n    await websocket.accept()\n\n    async def _user_input(prompt: str, cancellation_token: CancellationToken | None) -> str:\n        data = await websocket.receive_json() # Wait for user message from websocket.\n        message = TextMessage.model_validate(data) # Assume user message is a TextMessage.\n        return message.content\n    \n    # Create user proxy with custom input function\n    # Run the team with the user proxy\n    # ...\n```\n\nSee the [AgentChat FastAPI sample](./samples/fastapi) for a complete example.\n\nFor ChainLit integration with `UserProxyAgent`, see the [AgentChat ChainLit sample](./samples/chainlit).\n\n## Providing Feedback to the Next Run\n\nOften times, an application or a user interacts with the team of agents in an interactive loop: the team runs until termination, the application or user provides feedback, and the team runs again with the feedback.\n\nThis approach is useful in a persisted session with asynchronous communication between the team and the application/user: Once a team finishes a run, the application saves the state of the team, puts it in a persistent storage, and resumes the team when the feedback arrives.\n\n> **Note**: For how to save and load the state of a team, please refer to [Managing State](./managing-state.md). This section will focus on the feedback mechanisms.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the flow of control in this approach:\n\n![human-in-the-loop-termination](./images/human-in-the-loop-termination.png)\n\nThere are two ways to implement this approach:\n\n1. **Set the maximum number of turns** so that the team always stops after the specified number of turns.\n2. **Use termination conditions** such as `TextMentionTermination` and `HandoffTermination` to allow the team to decide when to stop and give control back, given the team's internal state.\n\nYou can use both methods together to achieve your desired behavior.\n\n### Using Max Turns\n\nThis method allows you to pause the team for user input by setting a maximum number of turns. For instance, you can configure the team to stop after the first agent responds by setting `max_turns` to 1. This is particularly useful in scenarios where continuous user engagement is required, such as in a chatbot.\n\nTo implement this, set the `max_turns` parameter in the `RoundRobinGroupChat()` constructor.\n\n```python\nteam = RoundRobinGroupChat([...], max_turns=1)\n```\n\nOnce the team stops, the turn count will be reset. When you resume the team, it will start from 0 again. However, the team's internal state will be preserved, for example, the `RoundRobinGroupChat` will resume from the next agent in the list with the same conversation history.\n\n> **Note**: `max_turn` is specific to the team class and is currently only supported by `RoundRobinGroupChat`, `SelectorGroupChat`, and `Swarm`. When used with termination conditions, the team will stop when either condition is met.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `max_turns` in a `RoundRobinGroupChat` for a poetry generation task with a maximum of 1 turn:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\n# Create the agents.\nmodel_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", model_client=model_client)\n\n# Create the team setting a maximum number of turns to 1.\nteam = RoundRobinGroupChat([assistant], max_turns=1)\n\ntask = \"Write a 4-line poem about the ocean.\"\nwhile True:\n    # Run the conversation and stream to the console.\n    stream = team.run_stream(task=task)\n    # Use asyncio.run(...) when running in a script.\n    await Console(stream)\n    # Get the user response.\n    task = input(\"Enter your feedback (type 'exit' to leave): \")\n    if task.lower().strip() == \"exit\":\n        break\nawait model_client.close()\n```\n\n**출력:**\n```\n----------
