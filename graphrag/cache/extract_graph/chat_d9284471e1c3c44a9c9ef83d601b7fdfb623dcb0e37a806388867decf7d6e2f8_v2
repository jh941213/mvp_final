The solver agents are connected in a sparse manner following the technique described in Improving Multi-Agent Debate with Sparse Communication Topology. The solver agents are responsible for solving math problems and exchanging responses with each other. The aggregator agent is responsible for distributing math problems to the solver agents, waiting for their final responses, and aggregating the responses to get the final answer.\n\nThe pattern works as follows:\n\n1. User sends a math problem to the aggregator agent.\n2. The aggregator agent distributes the problem to the solver agents.\n3. Each solver agent processes the problem, and publishes a response to its neighbors.\n4. Each solver agent uses the responses from its neighbors to refine its response, and publishes a new response.\n5. Repeat step 4 for a fixed number of rounds. In the final round, each solver agent publishes a final response.\n6. The aggregator agent uses majority voting to aggregate the final responses from all solver agents to get a final answer, and publishes the answer.\n\nWe will be using the broadcast API, i.e., `publish_message()`, and we will be using topic and subscription to implement the communication topology. Read about Topics and Subscriptions to understand how they work.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\nfrom autogen_core import (\n    DefaultTopicId,\n    MessageContext,\n    RoutedAgent,\n    SingleThreadedAgentRuntime,\n    TypeSubscription,\n    default_subscription,\n    message_handler,\n)\nfrom autogen_core.models import (\n    AssistantMessage,\n    ChatCompletionClient,\n    LLMMessage,\n    SystemMessage,\n    UserMessage,\n)\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n```\n\n## Message Protocol\n\nFirst, we define the messages used by the agents. `IntermediateSolverResponse` is the message exchanged among the solver agents in each round, and `FinalSolverResponse` is the message published by the solver agents in the final round.\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Question:\n    content: str\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass Answer:\n    content: str\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass SolverRequest:\n    content: str\n    question: str\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass IntermediateSolverResponse:\n    content: str\n    question: str\n    answer: str\n    round: int\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass FinalSolverResponse:\n    answer: str\n```\n\n## Solver Agent\n\nThe solver agent is responsible for solving math problems and exchanging responses with other solver agents. Upon receiving a `SolverRequest`, the solver agent uses an LLM to generate an answer. Then, it publishes a `IntermediateSolverResponse` or a `FinalSolverResponse` based on the round number.\n\nThe solver agent is given a topic type, which is used to indicate the topic to which the agent should publish intermediate responses. This topic is subscribed to by its neighbors to receive responses from this agent – we will show how this is done later.\n\nWe use `default_subscription()` to let solver agents subscribe to the default topic, which is used by the aggregator agent to collect the final responses from the solver agents.\n\n```python\n@default_subscription\nclass MathSolver(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, model_client: ChatCompletionClient, topic_type: str, num_neighbors: int, max_round: int) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"A debator.\")\n        self._topic_type = topic_type\n        self._model_client = model_client\n        self._num_neighbors = num_neighbors\n        self._history: List[LLMMessage] = []\n        self._buffer: Dict[int, List[IntermediateSolverResponse]] = {}\n        self._system_messages = [\n            SystemMessage(\n                content=(\n                    \"You are a helpful assistant with expertise in mathematics and reasoning. \"\n                    \"Your task is to assist in solving a math reasoning problem by providing \"\n                    \"a clear and detailed solution.
