To send a direct message to another agent, within a message handler use the `autogen_core.BaseAgent.send_message()` method, from the runtime use the `autogen_core.AgentRuntime.send_message()` method. Awaiting calls to these methods will return the return value of the receiving agent's message handler. When the receiving agent's handler returns `None`, `None` will be returned.\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> If the invoked agent raises an exception while the sender is awaiting, the exception will be propagated back to the sender.\n\n### Request/Response\n\nDirect messaging can be used for request/response scenarios, where the sender expects a response from the receiver. The receiver can respond to the message by returning a value from its message handler. You can think of this as a function call between agents.\n\nFor example, consider the following agents:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom autogen_core import MessageContext, RoutedAgent, SingleThreadedAgentRuntime, message_handler\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass Message:\n    content: str\n\n\nclass InnerAgent(RoutedAgent):\n    @message_handler\n    async def on_my_message(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> Message:\n        return Message(content=f\"Hello from inner, {message.content}\")\n\n\nclass OuterAgent(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, description: str, inner_agent_type: str):\n        super().__init__(description)\n        self.inner_agent_id = AgentId(inner_agent_type, self.id.key)\n\n    @message_handler\n    async def on_my_message(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> None:\n        print(f\"Received message: {message.content}\")\n        # Send a direct message to the inner agent and receives a response.\n        response = await self.send_message(Message(f\"Hello from outer, {message.content}\"), self.inner_agent_id)\n        print(f\"Received inner response: {response.content}\")\n```\n\nUpone receving a message, the `OuterAgent` sends a direct message to the `InnerAgent` and receives a message in response.\n\nWe can test these agents by sending a `Message` to the `OuterAgent`.\n\n```python\nruntime = SingleThreadedAgentRuntime()\nawait InnerAgent.register(runtime, \"inner_agent\", lambda: InnerAgent(\"InnerAgent\"))\nawait OuterAgent.register(runtime, \"outer_agent\", lambda: OuterAgent(\"OuterAgent\", \"inner_agent\"))\nruntime.start()\nouter_agent_id = AgentId(\"outer_agent\", \"default\")\nawait runtime.send_message(Message(content=\"Hello, World!\"), outer_agent_id)\nawait runtime.stop_when_idle()\n```\n\n```\nReceived message: Hello, World!\nReceived inner response: Hello from inner, Hello from outer, Hello, World!\n```\n\nBoth outputs are produced by the `OuterAgent`'s message handler, however the second output is based on the response from the `InnerAgent`.\n\nGenerally speaking, direct messaging is appropriate for scenarios when the sender and recipient are tightly coupled – they are created together and the sender is linked to a specific instance of the recipient. For example, an agent executes tool calls by sending direct messages to an instance of `ToolAgent`, and uses the responses to form an action-observation loop.\n\n## Broadcast\n\nBroadcast is effectively the publish/subscribe model with topic and subscription. Read Topic and Subscription to learn the core concepts.\n\nThe key difference between direct messaging and broadcast is that broadcast cannot be used for request/response scenarios. When an agent publishes a message it is one way only, it cannot receive a response from any other agent, even if a receiving agent's handler returns a value.\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> If a response is given to a published message, it will be thrown away.\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> If an agent publishes a message type for which it is subscribed it will not receive the message it published. This is to prevent infinite loops.\n\n### Subscribe and Publish to Topics\n\nType-based subscription maps messages published to topics of a given topic type to agents of a given agent type. To make an agent that subsclasses `RoutedAgent` subscribe to a topic of a given topic type, you can use the `type_subscription()` class decorator.\n\nThe following example shows a `ReceiverAgent` class that subscribes to topics of \"default\" topic type using the `type_subscription()` decorator. and prints the received messages.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_core import RoutedAgent, message_handler, type_subscription\n\n\n@type_subscription(topic_type=\"default\")\nclass ReceivingAgent(RoutedAgent):\n    @message_handler\n    async def on_my_message(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> None:\n        print(f\"Received a message: {message\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AGENTID<|>COMPONENT<|>A
