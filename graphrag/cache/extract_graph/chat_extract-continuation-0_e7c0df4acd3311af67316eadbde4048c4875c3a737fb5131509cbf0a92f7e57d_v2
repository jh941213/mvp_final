However, a run can go on forever, and in many cases, we need to know when to stop them. This is the role of the termination condition.\n\nAgentChat supports several termination condition by providing a base `TerminationCondition` class and several implementations that inherit from it.\n\nA termination condition is a callable that takes a sequence of `BaseAgentEvent` or `BaseChatMessage` objects since the last time the condition was called, and returns a `StopMessage` if the conversation should be terminated, or `None` otherwise. Once a termination condition has been reached, it must be reset by calling `reset()` before it can be used again.\n\nSome important things to note about termination conditions:\n\n- They are stateful but reset automatically after each run (`run()` or `run_stream()`) is finished.\n- They can be combined using the AND and OR operators.\n\n> **Note**: For group chat teams (i.e., `RoundRobinGroupChat`, `SelectorGroupChat`, and `Swarm`), the termination condition is called after each agent responds. While a response may contain multiple inner messages, the team calls its termination condition just once for all the messages from a single response. So the condition is called with the \"delta sequence\" of messages since the last time it was called.\n\n## Built-In Termination Conditions\n\n- **MaxMessageTermination**: Stops after a specified number of messages have been produced, including both agent and task messages.\n- **TextMentionTermination**: Stops when specific text or string is mentioned in a message (e.g., \"TERMINATE\").\n- **TokenUsageTermination**: Stops when a certain number of prompt or completion tokens are used. This requires the agents to report token usage in their messages.\n- **TimeoutTermination**: Stops after a specified duration in seconds.\n- **HandoffTermination**: Stops when a handoff to a specific target is requested. Handoff messages can be used to build patterns such as Swarm. This is useful when you want to pause the run and allow application or user to provide input when an agent hands off to them.\n- **SourceMatchTermination**: Stops after a specific agent responds.\n- **ExternalTermination**: Enables programmatic control of termination from outside the run. This is useful for UI integration (e.g., \"Stop\" buttons in chat interfaces).\n- **StopMessageTermination**: Stops when a `StopMessage` is produced by an agent.\n- **TextMessageTermination**: Stops when a `TextMessage` is produced by an agent.\n- **FunctionCallTermination**: Stops when a `ToolCallExecutionEvent` containing a `FunctionExecutionResult` with a matching name is produced by an agent.\n- **FunctionalTermination**: Stop when a function expression is evaluated to True on the last delta sequence of messages. This is useful for quickly create custom termination conditions that are not covered by the built-in ones.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nTo demonstrate the characteristics of termination conditions, we'll create a team consisting of two agents: a primary agent responsible for text generation and a critic agent that reviews and provides feedback on the generated text.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination, TextMentionTermination\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\nmodel_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    temperature=1,\n    # api_key=\"sk-...\", # Optional if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY env variable set.\n)\n\n# Create the primary agent.\nprimary_agent = AssistantAgent(\n    \"primary\",\n    model_client=model_client,\n    system_message=\"You are a helpful AI assistant.\",\n)\n\n# Create the critic agent.\ncritic_agent = AssistantAgent(\n    \"critic\",\n    model_client=model_client,\n    system_message=\"Provide constructive feedback for every message. Respond with 'APPROVE' to when your feedbacks are addressed.\",\n)\n```\n\nLet's explore how termination conditions automatically reset after each run or run_stream call, allowing the team to resume its conversation from where it left off.\n\n```python\nmax_msg_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=3)\nround_robin_team = RoundRobinGroupChat([primary_agent, critic_agent], termination_condition=max_msg_termination)\n\n# Use asyncio.run(...) if you are running this script as a standalone script.\nawait Console(round_robin_team.run_stream(task=\"Write a unique, Haiku about the weather in Paris\"))\n```\n\n**출력:**\n```\n---------- user ----------\nWrite a unique, Haiku about the weather in Paris\n---------- primary ----------\nGentle rain whispers,  \nCobblestones glisten softly—  \nParis dreams in gray.\n[Prompt tokens: 30, Completion tokens: 19]\n---------- critic ----------\nThe Haiku captures the essence of a rainy day in Paris beautifully, and the imagery is vivid. However, it's important to ensure the use of the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure for Haikus. Your current Haiku lines are composed of 4-7-5 syllables, which slightly deviates from the form. Consider revising the first line to fit the structure.\n\nFor example:\nSoft rain whispers down,  \nCobblestones glisten softly —  \nParis dreams in gray.\n\nThis revision maintains the essence of your original lines while adhering to the traditional Haiku structure.\n[Prompt tokens: 70, Completion tokens: 120]\n---------- Summary ----------\nNumber of messages: 3\nFinish reason: Maximum number
