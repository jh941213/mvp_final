If you are building a custom agent and have events that you want to communicate to other entities (e.g., a UI), you can include these in the `inner_messages` field of the `Response`.

This section will focus on how to interact with the team from your application, and provide human feedback to the team.\n\nThere are two main ways to interact with the team from your application:\n\n1. **During a team's run** – execution of `run()` or `run_stream()`, provide feedback through a `UserProxyAgent`.\n2. **Once the run terminates**, provide feedback through input to the next call to `run()` or `run_stream()`.\n\nWe will cover both methods in this section.\n\nTo jump straight to code samples on integration with web and UI frameworks, see the following links:\n- [AgentChat + FastAPI](./samples/fastapi)\n- [AgentChat + ChainLit](./samples/chainlit)\n- [AgentChat + Streamlit](./samples/streamlit)\n\n## Providing Feedback During a Run\n\nThe `UserProxyAgent` is a special built-in agent that acts as a proxy for a user to provide feedback to the team.\n\nTo use the `UserProxyAgent`, you can create an instance of it and include it in the team before running the team. The team will decide when to call the `UserProxyAgent` to ask for feedback from the user.\n\nFor example in a `RoundRobinGroupChat` team, the `UserProxyAgent` is called in the order in which it is passed to the team, while in a `SelectorGroupChat` team, the selector prompt or selector function determines when the `UserProxyAgent` is called.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how you can use `UserProxyAgent` to get feedback from the user during a team's run:\n\n![human-in-the-loop-user-proxy](./images/human-in-the-loop-user-proxy.png)\n\nThe bold arrows indicates the flow of control during a team's run: when the team calls the `UserProxyAgent`, it transfers the control to the application/user, and waits for the feedback; once the feedback is provided, the control is transferred back to the team and the team continues its execution.\n\n> **Note**: When `UserProxyAgent` is called during a run, it blocks the execution of the team until the user provides feedback or errors out. This will hold up the team's progress and put the team in an unstable state that cannot be saved or resumed.\n>\n> Due to the blocking nature of this approach, it is recommended to use it only for short interactions that require immediate feedback from the user, such as asking for approval or disapproval with a button click, or an alert requiring immediate attention otherwise failing the task.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `UserProxyAgent` in a `RoundRobinGroupChat` for a poetry generation task:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\n# Create the agents.\nmodel_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", model_client=model_client)\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\", input_func=input)  # Use input() to get user input from console.\n\n# Create the termination condition which will end the conversation when the user says \"APPROVE\".\ntermination = TextMentionTermination(\"APPROVE\")\n\n# Create the team.\nteam = RoundRobinGroupChat([assistant, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)\n\n# Run the conversation and stream to the console.\nstream = team.run_stream(task=\"Write a 4-line poem about the ocean.\")\n# Use asyncio.run(...) when running in a script.\nawait Console(stream)\nawait model_client.close()\n```\n\n**출력:**\n```\n---------- user ----------\nWrite a 4-line poem about the ocean.\n---------- assistant ----------\nIn endless blue where whispers play,  \nThe ocean's waves dance night and day.  \nA world of depths, both calm and wild,  \nNature's heart, forever beguiled.  \nTERMINATE\n---------- user_proxy ----------\nAPPROVE\nTaskResult(messages=[TextMessage(source='user', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Write a 4-line poem about the ocean.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='assistant', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=46, completion_tokens=43), metadata={}, content=\"In endless blue where whispers play,  \\nThe ocean's waves dance night and day.  \\nA world of depths, both calm and wild,  \\nNature's heart, forever beguiled.  \\nTERMINATE\", type='TextMessage'), UserInputRequestedEvent(source='user_proxy', models_usage=None, metadata={}, request_id='2622a0aa-b776-4e54-9e8f-4ecbdf14b78d', content='', type='UserInputRequestedEvent'), TextMessage(source='user_proxy', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='APPROVE', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'APPROVE' mentioned\")\n```\n\nFrom the console output, you can see the team solicited feedback from the user through `user_proxy` to approve the generated poem.\n\nYou can provide your own input function to the `UserProxyAgent` to customize the feedback process. For example, when the team is running as a web service, you can use a custom input function to wait for message from a web socket connection. The following code snippet shows an example of custom input function when using the FastAPI web framework:\n\n```python\n@app.websocket(\"/ws/chat\")\nasync def chat(websocket: WebSocket):\n    await websocket.accept()\n\n    async def _user\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1ac8dff0f803a4893d860af5ecfb47dc2e22fa706545d6cfaf28ed43997b253e_v2"}
