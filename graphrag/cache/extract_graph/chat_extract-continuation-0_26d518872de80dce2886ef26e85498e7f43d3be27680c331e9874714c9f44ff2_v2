Both types provide a common set of APIs for building multi-agent applications, so you can switch between them without changing your agent implementation. Each type can also have multiple implementations.\n\n## Standalone Agent Runtime\n\nStandalone runtime is suitable for single-process applications where all agents are implemented in the same programming language and running in the same process. In the Python API, an example of standalone runtime is the `SingleThreadedAgentRuntime`.\n\nThe following diagram shows the standalone runtime in the framework.\n\n**Standalone Runtime**\n\nHere, agents communicate via messages through the runtime, and the runtime manages the lifecycle of agents.\n\nDevelopers can build agents quickly by using the provided components including routed agent, AI model clients, tools for AI models, code execution sandboxes, model context stores, and more. They can also implement their own agents from scratch, or use other libraries.\n\n## Distributed Agent Runtime\n\nDistributed runtime is suitable for multi-process applications where agents may be implemented in different programming languages and running on different machines.\n\n**Distributed Runtime**\n\nA distributed runtime, as shown in the diagram above, consists of a **host servicer** and multiple **workers**. The host servicer facilitates communication between agents across workers and maintains the states of connections. The workers run agents and communicate with the host servicer via gateways. They advertise to the host servicer the agents they run and manage the agents' lifecycles.\n\nAgents work the same way as in the standalone runtime so that developers can switch between the two runtime types with no change to their agent implementation.\n\n## Application Stack\n\nAutoGen core is designed to be an unopinionated framework that can be used to build a wide variety of multi-agent applications. It is not tied to any specific agent abstraction or multi-agent pattern.\n\nThe following diagram shows the application stack.\n\n**Application Stack**\n\nAt the bottom of the stack is the base messaging and routing facilities that enable agents to communicate with each other. These are managed by the agent runtime, and for most applications, developers only need to interact with the high-level APIs provided by the runtime (see Agent and Agent Runtime).\n\nAt the top of the stack, developers need to define the types of the messages that agents exchange. This set of message types forms a **behavior contract** that agents must adhere to, and the implementation of the contracts determines how agents handle messages. The behavior contract is also sometimes referred to as the **message protocol**. It is the developer's responsibility to implement the behavior contract. Multi-agent patterns emerge from these behavior contracts (see Multi-Agent Design Patterns).\n\n## An Example Application\n\nConsider a concrete example of a multi-agent application for code generation. The application consists of three agents: **Coder Agent**, **Executor Agent**, and **Reviewer Agent**. The following diagram shows the data flow between the agents, and the message types exchanged between them.\n\n**Code Generation Example**\n\nIn this example, the behavior contract consists of the following:\n\n- `CodingTaskMsg` message from application to the Coder Agent\n- `CodeGenMsg` from Coder Agent to Executor Agent\n- `ExecutionResultMsg` from Executor Agent to Reviewer Agent\n- `ReviewMsg` from Reviewer Agent to Coder Agent\n- `CodingResultMsg` from the Reviewer Agent to the application\n\nThe behavior contract is implemented by the agents' handling of these messages. For example, the Reviewer Agent listens for `ExecutionResultMsg` and evaluates the code execution result to decide whether to approve or reject, if approved, it sends a `CodingResultMsg` to the application, otherwise, it sends a `ReviewMsg` to the Coder Agent for another round of code generation.\n\nThis behavior contract is a case of a multi-agent pattern called **reflection**, where a generation result is reviewed by another round of generation, to improve the overall quality.\n\n# Agent Identity and Lifecycle\n\nThe agent runtime manages agents' identities and lifecycles. Application does not create agents directly, rather, it registers an agent type with a factory function for agent instances. In this section, we explain how agents are identified and created by the runtime.\n\n## Agent ID\n\nAgent ID uniquely identifies an agent instance within an agent runtime – including distributed runtime. It is the \"address\" of the agent instance for receiving messages. It has two components: agent type and agent key.\n\n> **Note:** Agent ID = (Agent Type, Agent Key)\n\nThe agent type is not an agent class. It associates an agent with a specific factory function, which produces instances of agents of the same agent type. For example, different factory functions can produce the same agent class but with different constructor parameters. The agent key is an instance identifier for the given agent type. Agent IDs can be converted to and from strings. the format of this string is:\n\n> **Note:** Agent_Type/Agent_Key\n\nTypes and Keys are considered valid if they only contain alphanumeric letters (a-z) and (0-9), or underscores (_). A valid identifier cannot start with a number, or contain any spaces.\n\nIn a multi-agent application, agent types are typically defined directly by the application, i.e., they are defined in the application code. On the other hand, agent keys are typically generated given messages delivered to the agents, i.e., they are defined by the application data.\n\nFor example, a runtime has registered the agent type \"code_reviewer\" with a factory function producing agent instances that perform code reviews. Each code review request has a unique ID `review_request_id` to mark a dedicated session. In this case, each request can be handled by a new instance with an agent ID, (\"code_reviewer\", review_request_id).\n\n## Agent\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
