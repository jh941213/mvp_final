It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in Swarm. The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in SelectorGroupChat.\n\n> **Note**: Swarm is a high-level API. If you need more control and customization that is not supported by this API, you can take a look at the Handoff Pattern in the Core API documentation and implement your own version of the Swarm pattern.\n\n## How Does It Work?\n\nAt its core, the Swarm team is a group chat where agents take turn to generate a response. Similar to `SelectorGroupChat` and `RoundRobinGroupChat`, participant agents broadcast their responses so all agents share the same message context.\n\nDifferent from the other two group chat teams, at each turn, the speaker agent is selected based on the most recent `HandoffMessage` message in the context. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate `HandoffMessage` to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n\nFor `AssistantAgent`, you can set the `handoffs` argument to specify which agents it can hand off to. You can use `Handoff` to customize the message content and handoff behavior.\n\nThe overall process can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Each agent has the ability to generate `HandoffMessage` to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For `AssistantAgent`, this means setting the `handoffs` argument.\n\n2. When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make localized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n\n3. When an agent generates a `HandoffMessage`, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n\n4. The process continues until a termination condition is met.\n\n> **Note**: The `AssistantAgent` uses the tool calling capability of the model to generate handoffs. This means that the model must support tool calling. If the model does parallel tool calling, multiple handoffs may be generated at the same time. This can lead to unexpected behavior. To avoid this, you can disable parallel tool calling by configuring the model client. For `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` and `AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient`, you can set `parallel_tool_calls=False` in the configuration.\n\nIn this section, we will show you two examples of how to use the Swarm team:\n\n- A customer support team with human-in-the-loop handoff.\n- An autonomous team for content generation.\n\n## Customer Support Example\n\nThis system implements a flights refund scenario with two agents:\n\n- **Travel Agent**: Handles general travel and refund coordination.\n- **Flights Refunder**: Specializes in processing flight refunds with the `refund_flight` tool.\n\nAdditionally, we let the user interact with the agents, when agents handoff to \"user\".\n\n### Workflow\n\n1. The Travel Agent initiates the conversation and evaluates the user's request.\n2. Based on the request:\n   - For refund-related tasks, the Travel Agent hands off to the Flights Refunder.\n   - For information needed from the customer, either agent can hand off to the \"user\".\n3. The Flights Refunder processes refunds using the `refund_flight` tool when appropriate.\n4. If an agent hands off to the \"user\", the team execution will stop and wait for the user to input a response.\n5. When the user provides input, it's sent back to the team as a `HandoffMessage`. This message is directed to the agent that originally requested user input.\n6. The process continues until the Travel Agent determines the task is complete and terminates the workflow.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List\n\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.conditions import HandoffTermination, TextMentionTermination\nfrom autogen_agentchat.messages import HandoffMessage\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import Swarm\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n```\n\n### Tools\n\n```python\ndef refund_flight(flight_id: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Refund a flight\"\"\"\n    return f\"Flight {flight_id} refunded\"\n```\n\n### Agents\n\n```python\nmodel_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(\n    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n    # api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",\n)\n\ntravel_agent = AssistantAgent(\n    \"travel_agent\",\n    model_client=model_client,\n    handoffs=[\"flights_refunder\", \"user\"],\n    system_message=\"\"\"You are a travel agent.\n    The flights_refunder is in charge of refunding flights.\n    If you need information from the user, you must first send your message, then you can handoff to the user.\n    Use TERMINATE when the travel planning is complete.\"\"\",\n)\n\nflights_refunder = AssistantAgent(\n    \"flights_refunder\",\n    model_client=model_client,\n    handoffs=[\"travel_agent\", \"user\"],\n    tools=[refund_flight],\n    system_message=\"\"\"You are an agent specialized in refunding flights.\n    You only need flight reference numbers to refund a flight.\n    You have the ability to refund a flight using the refund_flight tool.\n    If you need information from the user, you must first send your message, then you can handoff to the user.\n    When the transaction is complete, handoff to the travel agent to finalize.\"\"\",\n)\n\ntermination = HandoffTermination(target=\"user\") | TextMentionTermination(\"TERMINATE\")\nteam = Swarm([travel_agent, flights_refunder], termination_condition=termination)\ntask =\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_00704dbe1c831d4d76a5f54d5d725cc4051fc475f52d00becca47ba1b610da34_v2"}
