Each code review request has a unique ID `review_request_id` to mark a dedicated session. In this case, each request can be handled by a new instance with an agent ID, (\"code_reviewer\", review_request_id).\n\n## Agent Lifecycle\n\nWhen a runtime delivers a message to an agent instance given its ID, it either fetches the instance, or creates it if it does not exist.\n\n**Agent Lifecycle**\n\nThe runtime is also responsible for \"paging in\" or \"out\" agent instances to conserve resources and balance load across multiple machines. This is not implemented yet\n\n# Topic and Subscription\n\nThere are two ways for runtime to deliver messages, **direct messaging** or **broadcast**. Direct messaging is one to one: the sender must provide the recipient's agent ID. On the other hand, broadcast is one to many and the sender does not provide recipients' agent IDs.\n\nMany scenarios are suitable for broadcast. For example, in event-driven workflows, agents do not always know who will handle their messages, and a workflow can be composed of agents with no inter-dependencies. This section focuses on the core concepts in broadcast: topic and subscription.\n\n## Topic\n\nA topic defines the scope of a broadcast message. In essence, agent runtime implements a publish-subscribe model through its broadcast API: when publishing a message, the topic must be specified. It is an indirection over agent IDs.\n\nA topic consists of two components: topic type and topic source.\n\n> **Note:** Topic = (Topic Type, Topic Source)\n\nSimilar to agent ID, which also has two components, topic type is usually defined by application code to mark the type of messages the topic is for. For example, a GitHub agent may use \"GitHub_Issues\" as the topic type when publishing messages about new issues.\n\nTopic source is the unique identifier for a topic within a topic type. It is typically defined by application data. For example, the GitHub agent may use \"github.com/{repo_name}/issues/{issue_number}\" as the topic source to uniquely identifies the topic. Topic source allows the publisher to limit the scope of messages and create silos.\n\nTopic IDs can be converted to and from strings. the format of this string is:\n\n> **Note:** Topic_Type/Topic_Source\n\nTypes are considered valid if they are in UTF8 and only contain alphanumeric letters (a-z) and (0-9), or underscores (_). A valid identifier cannot start with a number, or contain any spaces. Sources are considered valid if they are in UTF8 and only contain characters between (inclusive) ascii 32 (space) and 126 (~).\n\n## Subscription\n\nA subscription maps topic to agent IDs.\n\n**Subscription**\n\nThe diagram above shows the relationship between topic and subscription. An agent runtime keeps track of the subscriptions and uses them to deliver messages to agents.\n\nIf a topic has no subscription, messages published to this topic will not be delivered to any agent. If a topic has many subscriptions, messages will be delivered following all the subscriptions to every recipient agent only once. Applications can add or remove subscriptions using agent runtime's API.\n\n## Type-based Subscription\n\nA type-based subscription maps a topic type to an agent type (see agent ID). It declares an unbounded mapping from topics to agent IDs without knowing the exact topic sources and agent keys. The mechanism is simple: any topic matching the type-based subscription's topic type will be mapped to an agent ID with the subscription's agent type and the agent key assigned to the value of the topic source. For Python API, use `TypeSubscription`.\n\n> **Note:** Type-Based Subscription = Topic Type –> Agent Type\n\nGenerally speaking, type-based subscription is the preferred way to declare subscriptions. It is portable and data-independent: developers do not need to write application code that depends on specific agent IDs.\n\n### Scenarios of Type-Based Subscription\n\nType-based subscriptions can be applied to many scenarios when the exact topic or agent IDs are data-dependent. The scenarios can be broken down by two considerations: (1) whether it is single-tenant or multi-tenant, and (2) whether it is a single topic or multiple topics per tenant. A tenant typically refers to a set of agents that handle a specific user session or a specific request.\n\n#### Single-Tenant, Single Topic\n\nIn this scenario, there is only one tenant and one topic for the entire application. It is the simplest scenario and can be used in many cases like a command line tool or a single-user application.\n\nTo apply type-based subscription for this scenario, create one type-based subscription for each agent type, and use the same topic type for all the type-based subscriptions. When you publish, always use the same topic, i.e., the same topic type and topic source.\n\nFor example, assuming there are three agent types: \"triage_agent\", \"coder_agent\" and \"reviewer_agent\", and the topic type is \"default\", create the following type-based subscriptions:\n\n```python\n# Type-based Subscriptions for single-tenant, single topic scenario\nTypeSubscription(topic_type=\"default\", agent_type=\"triage_agent\")\nTypeSubscription(topic_type=\"default\", agent_type=\"coder_agent\")\nTypeSubscription(topic_type=\"default\", agent_type=\"reviewer_agent\")\n```\n\nWith the above type-based subscriptions, use the same topic source \"default\" for all messages. So the topic is always (\"default\", \"default\"). A message published to this topic will be delivered to all the agents of all above types. Specifically, the message will be sent to the following agent IDs:\n\n```python\n# The agent IDs created based on the topic source\nAgentID(\"triage_agent\", \"default\")\nAgentID(\"coder_agent\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AGENT_KEYS<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Keys generated for agents based on messages delivered to them, defined by application data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CODE_REVIEWER<|>AGENT<|>An agent type registered in the runtime to perform code reviews, with unique IDs for each session)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVIEW_REQUEST_ID<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A unique identifier for each code review request, used to mark dedicated sessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGENT_LIFECYCLE<|>WORKFLOW<|>The lifecycle of an agent, including creation, fetching, and resource management by the runtime)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGING<|>WORKFLOW<|>The process of \"paging in\" or \"out\" agent instances to conserve resources and balance load across machines, not yet implemented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECT_MESSAGING<|>MESSAGE<|>A one-to-one messaging method where the sender specifies the recipient's agent ID)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROADCAST<|>MESSAGE<|>A one-to-many messaging method where the sender does not specify recipient agent IDs, suitable for event-driven workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPIC<|>COMPONENT<|>Defines the scope of a broadcast message, consisting of a topic type and topic source, used in the publish-subscribe model)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPIC_TYPE<|>CONFIGURATION<|>Defines the type of messages a topic is for, usually specified by application code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPIC_SOURCE<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A unique identifier for a topic within a topic type, typically defined by application data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOPIC_ID<|>CONFIGURATION<|>A string representation of a topic, formatted as \"Topic_Type/Topic_Source\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSCRIPTION<|>SUBSCRIPTION<|>Maps topics to agent IDs, enabling message delivery to agents based on topics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION<|>SUBSCRIPTION<|>A type-based subscription that maps a topic type to an agent type, allowing unbounded mapping without specific topic sources or agent keys)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIAGE_AGENT<|>AGENT<|>An agent type used in a single-tenant, single-topic scenario, mapped to the \"default\" topic type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CODER_AGENT<|>AGENT<|>An agent type used in a single-tenant, single-topic scenario, mapped to the \"default\" topic type)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVIEWER_AGENT<|>AGENT<|>An agent type used in a single-tenant, single-topic scenario, mapped to the \"default\" topic type)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CODE_REVIEWER<|>REVIEW_REQUEST_ID<|>The Code_Reviewer agent uses the Review_Request_ID to uniquely identify each session<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGENT_LIFECYCLE<|>PAGING<|>Paging is part of the agent lifecycle, used to manage resources and balance load<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROADCAST<|>TOPIC<|>Broadcast messages are scoped by topics, which define their reach<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPIC<|>TOPIC_TYPE<|>A topic consists of a topic type, which defines the type of messages it is for<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPIC<|>TOPIC_SOURCE<|>A topic consists of a topic source, which uniquely identifies it within a topic type<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOPIC<|>TOPIC_ID<|>A topic ID is a string representation of a topic, combining its type and source<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBSCRIPTION<|>TOPIC<|>Subscriptions map topics to agent IDs, enabling message delivery<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION<|>SUBSCRIPTION<|>Type_Subscription is a specific type of subscription that maps topic types to agent types<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION<|>TRIAGE_AGENT<|>Type-based subscriptions can map the \"default\" topic type to the Triage_Agent<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION<|>CODER_AGENT<|>Type-based subscriptions can map the \"default\" topic type to the Coder_Agent<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION<|>REVIEWER_AGENT<|>Type-based subscriptions can map the \"default\" topic type to the Reviewer_Agent<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIAGE_AGENT<|>CODER_AGENT<|>Both Triage_Agent and Coder_Agent are part of the single-tenant, single-topic scenario<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIAGE_AGENT<|>REVIEWER_AGENT<|>Both Triage_Agent and Reviewer_Agent are part of the single-tenant, single-topic scenario<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CODER_AGENT<|>REVIEWER_AGENT<|>Both Coder_Agent and Reviewer_Agent are part of the single-tenant, single-topic scenario<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
