It uses structured execution and precisely controls how agents interact to accomplish a task.\n\nWe'll first show you how to create and run a flow. We'll then explain how to observe and debug flow behavior, and discuss important operations for managing execution.\n\nAutoGen AgentChat provides a team for directed graph execution:\n\n**GraphFlow**: A team that follows a DiGraph to control the execution flow between agents. Supports sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping behaviors.\n\n> **Note**: When should you use GraphFlow?\n>\n> Use Graph when you need strict control over the order in which agents act, or when different outcomes must lead to different next steps. Start with a simple team such as `RoundRobinGroupChat` or `SelectorGroupChat` if ad-hoc conversation flow is sufficient. Transition to a structured workflow when your task requires deterministic control, conditional branching, or handling complex multi-step processes with cycles.\n\n> **Warning**: GraphFlow is an experimental feature. Its API, behavior, and capabilities are subject to change in future releases.\n\n## Creating and Running a Flow\n\n`DiGraphBuilder` is a fluent utility that lets you easily construct execution graphs for workflows. It supports building:\n\n- Sequential chains\n- Parallel fan-outs\n- Conditional branching\n- Loops with safe exit conditions\n\nEach node in the graph represents an agent, and edges define the allowed execution paths. Edges can optionally have conditions based on agent messages.\n\n### Sequential Flow\n\nWe will begin by creating a simple workflow where a writer drafts a paragraph and a reviewer provides feedback. This graph terminates after the reviewer comments on the writer.\n\nNote, the flow automatically computes all the source and leaf nodes of the graph and the execution starts at all the source nodes in the graph and completes execution when no nodes are left to execute.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import DiGraphBuilder, GraphFlow\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\n# Create an OpenAI model client\nclient = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\")\n\n# Create the writer agent\nwriter = AssistantAgent(\"writer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Draft a short paragraph on climate change.\")\n\n# Create the reviewer agent\nreviewer = AssistantAgent(\"reviewer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Review the draft and suggest improvements.\")\n\n# Build the graph\nbuilder = DiGraphBuilder()\nbuilder.add_node(writer).add_node(reviewer)\nbuilder.add_edge(writer, reviewer)\n\n# Build and validate the graph\ngraph = builder.build()\n\n# Create the flow\nflow = GraphFlow([writer, reviewer], graph=graph)\n# Use `asyncio.run(...)` and wrap the below in a async function when running in a script.\nstream = flow.run_stream(task=\"Write a short paragraph about climate change.\")\nasync for event in stream:  # type: ignore\n    print(event)\n# Use Console(flow.run_stream(...)) for better formatting in console.\n```\n\n### Parallel Flow with Join\n\nWe now create a slightly more complex flow:\n\n1. A writer drafts a paragraph.\n2. Two editors independently edit for grammar and style (parallel fan-out).\n3. A final reviewer consolidates their edits (join).\n\nExecution starts at the writer, fans out to editor1 and editor2 simultaneously, and then both feed into the final reviewer.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import DiGraphBuilder, GraphFlow\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\n# Create an OpenAI model client\nclient = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\")\n\n# Create the writer agent\nwriter = AssistantAgent(\"writer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Draft a short paragraph on climate change.\")\n\n# Create two editor agents\neditor1 = AssistantAgent(\"editor1\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Edit the paragraph for grammar.\")\n\neditor2 = AssistantAgent(\"editor2\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Edit the paragraph for style.\")\n\n# Create the final reviewer agent\nfinal_reviewer = AssistantAgent(\n    \"final_reviewer\",\n    model_client=client,\n    system_message=\"Consolidate the grammar and style edits into a final version.\",\n)\n\n# Build the workflow graph\nbuilder = DiGraphBuilder()\nbuilder.add_node(writer).add_node(editor1).add_node(editor2).add_node(final_reviewer)\n\n# Fan-out from writer to editor1 and editor2\nbuilder.add_edge(writer, editor1)\nbuilder.add_edge(writer, editor2)\n\n# Fan-in both editors into final reviewer\nbuilder.add_edge(editor1, final_reviewer)\nbuilder.add_edge(editor2, final_reviewer)\n\n# Build and validate the graph\ngraph = builder.build()\n\n# Create the flow\nflow = GraphFlow(\n    participants=builder.get_participants(),\n    graph=graph,\n)\n\n# Run the workflow\nawait Console(flow.run_stream(task=\"Write a short paragraph about climate change.\"))\n```\n\n## Message Filtering\n\n### Execution Graph vs. Message Graph\n\nIn GraphFlow, the execution graph is defined using DiGraph, which controls the order in which agents execute. However, the execution graph does not control what messages an agent receives from other agents. By default, all messages are sent to all agents in the graph.\n\nMessage filtering is a separate feature that allows you to filter the messages received by each agent and limiting their model context to only the relevant information. The set of message filters defines the message graph in the flow.\n\nSpecifying the message graph can help with:\n\n- Reduce hallucinations\n- Control memory load\n- Focus\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8a89f49e3404509de9a68a6bd9ed84b8b8af8f89486f86bc1234cf82ab020a0e_v2"}
