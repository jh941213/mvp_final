The Orchestrator begins by creating a plan to tackle the task, gathering needed facts and educated guesses in a **Task Ledger** that is maintained. At each step of its plan, the Orchestrator creates a **Progress Ledger** where it self-reflects on task progress and checks whether the task is completed. If the task is not yet completed, it assigns one of Magentic-One other agents a subtask to complete. After the assigned agent completes its subtask, the Orchestrator updates the Progress Ledger and continues in this way until the task is complete. If the Orchestrator finds that progress is not being made for enough steps, it can update the Task Ledger and create a new plan. This is illustrated in the figure above; the Orchestrator work is thus divided into an outer loop where it updates the Task Ledger and an inner loop to update the Progress Ledger.\n\nOverall, Magentic-One consists of the following agents:\n\n- **Orchestrator**: the lead agent responsible for task decomposition and planning, directing other agents in executing subtasks, tracking overall progress, and taking corrective actions as needed\n\n- **WebSurfer**: This is an LLM-based agent that is proficient in commanding and managing the state of a Chromium-based web browser. With each incoming request, the WebSurfer performs an action on the browser then reports on the new state of the web page The action space of the WebSurfer includes navigation (e.g. visiting a URL, performing a web search); web page actions (e.g., clicking and typing); and reading actions (e.g., summarizing or answering questions). The WebSurfer relies on the accessibility tree of the browser and on set-of-marks prompting to perform its actions.\n\n- **FileSurfer**: This is an LLM-based agent that commands a markdown-based file preview application to read local files of most types. The FileSurfer can also perform common navigation tasks such as listing the contents of directories and navigating a folder structure.\n\n- **Coder**: This is an LLM-based agent specialized through its system prompt for writing code, analyzing information collected from the other agents, or creating new artifacts.\n\n- **ComputerTerminal**: Finally, ComputerTerminal provides the team with access to a console shell where the Coder's programs can be executed, and where new programming libraries can be installed.\n\nTogether, Magentic-One's agents provide the Orchestrator with the tools and capabilities that it needs to solve a broad variety of open-ended problems, as well as the ability to autonomously adapt to, and act in, dynamic and ever-changing web and file-system environments.\n\nWhile the default multimodal LLM we use for all agents is GPT-4o, Magentic-One is model agnostic and can incorporate heterogeneous models to support different capabilities or meet different cost requirements when getting tasks done. For example, it can use different LLMs and SLMs and their specialized versions to power different agents. We recommend a strong reasoning model for the Orchestrator agent such as GPT-4o. In a different configuration of Magentic-One, we also experiment with using OpenAI o1-preview for the outer loop of the Orchestrator and for the Coder, while other agents continue to use GPT-4o.\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_039324e66e6c8ad2ff5121a3292b06c314a0c3ea7254b1513ff9bb04ef5d1b77_v2"}
