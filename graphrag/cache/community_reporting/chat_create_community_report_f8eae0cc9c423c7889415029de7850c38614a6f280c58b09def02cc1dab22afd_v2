It is an asynchronous generator designed to execute tasks, workflows, or team operations in a streaming manner, enabling real-time interaction and incremental processing of inputs and outputs. This method is implemented in multiple contexts, including the `BaseChatAgent`, `BaseGroupChat`, `SelectorGroupChat`, `AssistantAgent`, and the `TaskRunner` protocol, where it facilitates the streaming of messages or response chunks as they are generated. In the `AssistantAgent`, it supports asynchronous task execution and real-time token output streaming, while in team-based workflows, it enables collaborative task execution with outputs directed to specified destinations, such as a console. The `run_stream` method is functionally similar to the `run()` method but is specifically optimized for streaming scenarios, concluding its operation by yielding a `TaskResult` as the final output.
