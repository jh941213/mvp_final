It is configured to process tasks autonomously but will defer or hand off tasks to the user when it encounters situations it cannot resolve independently. This dual approach allows the \"\"LAZY_ASSISTANT\"\" to balance automation with user involvement, ensuring tasks are addressed effectively while leveraging user input when necessary.\",4\n48,TEXTMESSAGE,\"The \"\"TEXTMESSAGE\"\" entity is a concrete subclass of the \"\"BaseChatMessage\"\" class, specifically designed for text-based communication. It is implemented as a dataclass and includes key attributes such as `content` (string-based text) and `source` (indicating the origin of the message). This message type facilitates plain text communication between entities, such as users, agents, or tools, and is commonly used to represent user inputs, agent responses, task-related exchanges, or final outputs. It plays a critical role in validating and processing user inputs, including those received from web sockets, and is often utilized in termination conditions or within classes like \"\"Response\"\" and \"\"TaskResult.\"\" By enabling the exchange of textual content, \"\"TEXTMESSAGE\"\" supports seamless interaction and collaboration between users and agents during tasks, making it a fundamental component in multi-agent communication frameworks.\",22\n953,TASKRUNNER,\"The \"\"TASKRUNNER\"\" is a versatile component and protocol designed for executing tasks within a system. It supports both standard and streaming execution through methods like `run` and `run_stream`, enabling dynamic task handling. TASKRUNNER is equipped with advanced features such as state management and the ability to utilize cancellation tokens, ensuring robust control over task execution. Additionally, it facilitates real-time monitoring of tasks, making it an essential element for managing workflows in multi-agent systems.\",5\n959,TERMINATEDEXCEPTION,\"The \"\"TERMINATEDEXCEPTION\"\" is an exception that is raised when a termination condition is met, signaling the normal conclusion of a conversation or process. It inherits from the \"\"BaseException\"\" class, aligning it with Python's exception hierarchy. Additionally, it is triggered when the termination condition has already been satisfied, thereby preventing any further execution. This exception serves as a control mechanism to ensure that processes or conversations are halted appropriately once their predefined end conditions are fulfilled.\",3\n659,TERMINATE,\"\"\"TERMINATE\"\" is a termination condition used within multi-agent systems to signal the end of a workflow, process, or interaction. It is triggered when the keyword \"\"TERMINATE\"\" is mentioned, serving as a specific text-based condition. This condition is employed by agents, such as the Travel Agent, to indicate the successful completion of a task or the conclusion of their workflow. The termination is approved by the UserProxyAgent, ensuring that the interaction or task is properly finalized.\",6\n35,RUN,\"The \"\"RUN\"\" method is a versatile and integral function utilized across various components in multi-agent systems. In the context of the **BaseChatAgent**, it executes the agent's behavior by invoking the `on_messages` method and returning a `Response` object. Within the **BaseGroupChat**, it facilitates team execution and delivers results. In the **SelectorGroupChat**, it is employed to analyze the context and determine the next speaker, ensuring task progression. As part of the **TaskRunner protocol**, it is responsible for executing tasks and returning the corresponding results. More broadly, the \"\"RUN\"\" method is a mechanism used by a team of agents to collaboratively execute tasks, often leveraging message-based communication. It is also capable of handling a given task or a list of messages, producing a `TaskResult` that encapsulates the agent's response and thought process. This method serves as a critical operational tool, enabling agents and teams to perform tasks efficiently while maintaining a structured flow of communication and decision-making.\",11\n37,TASKRESULT,\"The \"\"TASKRESULT\"\" is a component that encapsulates the results of a task executed by an agent or tool, providing structured output. It includes attributes such as the `stop_reason`, the conversation history, and the messages exchanged during the task. This object is returned by the `run()` method and contains a detailed list of messages that represent the agent's thought process and final response. In the context of SelectorGroupChat, it also serves as a record of the completed task's conversation history and outcomes, offering a comprehensive view of the task's execution and resolution.\",15\n973,STOP_REASON,An attribute of `TaskResult` that provides the reason for a task's completion or termination,2\n970,RUN_WITH_MONITORING,\"A workflow for executing tasks with monitoring, supporting streaming execution and handling task results or termination exceptions\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2838,DURATION,TEAM,The duration of task execution is tracked as part of the team workflow,48\n2842,LAZY_ASSISTANT,TEAM,The Lazy Assistant is part of a team workflow to complete tasks,48\n122,TEXTMESSAGE,REQUESTUSAGE,\"The **TextMessage** entity serves as a communication interface facilitating interactions between the user and the agent.
