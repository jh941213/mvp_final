Specifically, activation conditions are used to determine whether a target node within the group should wait for all inputs to be received or proceed upon receiving any input. Additionally, in the context of cyclic workflows, activation conditions play a critical role in deciding when nodes are executed, ensuring proper coordination and flow within iterative or looping processes. Together, these entities enable precise control over the execution dynamics of workflows, particularly in complex or cyclic scenarios.\",6\n2713,AGENT_A2,AGENT_B2,Agent A2 initiates a task and sends it to Agent B2 for coordination of parallel processing,6\n2714,AGENT_B2,AGENT_C1,\"Agent C1 sends its completion status back to Agent B2 to trigger the next step\nAgent B2 sends tasks to Agent C1 for handling task type 1 in parallel\",6\n2715,AGENT_B2,AGENT_C2,\"Agent C2 sends its completion status back to Agent B2 to trigger the next step\nAgent B2 sends tasks to Agent C2 for handling task type 2 in parallel\",6\n2486,DIGRAPHNODE,DIGRAPHEDGE,DiGraphNode connects to other nodes through DiGraphEdge components,5\n2487,DIGRAPHEDGE,CONDITION,Conditions are used in DiGraphEdge components to determine the activation of edges,5\n2685,ANALYST,PRESENTER,The Analyst agent sends its reviewed summary to the Presenter agent for preparing presentation slides,5\n2666,MESSAGE FILTERING,HALLUCINATIONS,Message filtering helps reduce hallucinations by limiting agents' context to relevant information,4\n2667,MESSAGE FILTERING,MEMORY LOAD,Message filtering helps control memory load by reducing the amount of information agents process,4\n2684,RESEARCHER,CLIMATE_CHANGE_SUMMARY,The Researcher agent is tasked with summarizing key facts about climate change,4\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_0020e66d08c7eddb0a3b3264ff23c55003b069fd82ed4709e90031487c5d9450_v2"}
