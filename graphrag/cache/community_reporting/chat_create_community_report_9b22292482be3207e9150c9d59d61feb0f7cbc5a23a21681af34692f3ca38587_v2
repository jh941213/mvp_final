It is returned when a termination condition, including custom-defined ones, is met. This message contains content and source information, as well as details about the function execution that triggered the termination. It serves as a mechanism to request or indicate the end of a conversation or workflow, often playing a critical role in ensuring proper handling of termination conditions within multi-agent systems.\",9\n625,FUNCTIONALTERMINATION,\"FUNCTIONALTERMINATION is a termination condition mechanism designed to end a conversation or process based on custom business logic. It operates by evaluating a user-defined function or expression against the last delta sequence of messages, determining whether the condition to terminate has been met. This approach is highly flexible, allowing for the detection of specific keywords, patterns, or other custom criteria within the message flow.
